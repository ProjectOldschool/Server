# Astraeus

Astraeus is a high performance RuneScape emulator for the #317 protocol. It aims to provide up-to-date conventions, high performance
and easy to use syntax that entry-level programmers can learn off of.

## History

Astraeus is my third framework for RuneScape. Astraeus is the predecessor of my previous Astraeus project that utilizes Java NIO that was developed in 2015.
